# Modeling Dyshomeostasis and Its Potential Causes by Active Inference

## Prerequisites
All our models use SPM12.
Unpack [spm12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) to the root folder of this project.

# Models
This repository contains the two models mentioned in the paper. 
- Model 1 can be evaluated by running [run.m](model1/run.m)
- Model 2 can be evaluated by running [trial.m](model2/Trial.m)


# Paper
Our [paper](paper.pdf) explains the active inference models.
